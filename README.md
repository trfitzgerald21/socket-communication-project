In this project, I learned how to establish and test a basic clientâ€“server communication system using Python sockets. I successfully built and ran a server script that listens for connections and a client script that connects and exchanges data. I demonstrated both successful and unsuccessful connection attempts, proving that proper error handling works when the server is not available. I also used a Python port-scanner script to show how to verify open and closed network ports. Throughout the project, I gained hands-on experience with sockets, troubleshooting, and GitHub repository management, which helped improve my confidence in networking and software version control.
